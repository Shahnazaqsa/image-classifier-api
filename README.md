A Django-based REST API for image classification using a CNN model

# Image Classifier API

This project is a Django-based REST API for classifying images using a trained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).

## 🔍 Features
- Upload image via API
- CNN model processes image and predicts label
- RESTful endpoint built with Django + Django REST Framework

## 🛠 Tech Stack
- Python
- TensorFlow / Keras
- Django + Django REST Framework
- SQLite (default)
- GitHub for version control

## 🚀 How It Works
1. Train CNN model on image dataset (e.g. digits, sign language)
2. Save trained model (.h5)
3. Build Django API to accept image uploads
4. API returns prediction as JSON response
